# BeFit

BeFit is an ASP.NET Core MVC application for tracking exercises and training sessions.

This repository contains the project files. To push this project to GitHub:

1. Create a repository on GitHub (or use the GitHub CLI `gh repo create`).
2. Add the remote: `git remote add origin <REMOTE_URL>`
3. Push the main branch: `git push -u origin master`

If you want me to create the GitHub repo and push for you, tell me whether you have the GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed or provide the repository URL.
